DON'T TOUCH THOSE, THEY'RE NOT READY. I swear, you boys never want to help us in the kitchen, but you always want to poke around.

Grandma-BLUE
We'll call you when it's ready, sweetie, just go play.

Mom-GREEN
Mom, how do you have so much patience?

Grandma-BLUE
Good food takes time, and I have you all to help me. I'm just happy to have my girls.
