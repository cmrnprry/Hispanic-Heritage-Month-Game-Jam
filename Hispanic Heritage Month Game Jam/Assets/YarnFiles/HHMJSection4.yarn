Did you hear Maria is pregnant?

No way. Really?

Yes! She's not telling anyone, but her mom told me.

But she's not married, right?

No!

Oh my god.

Is he going to marry her?

I'm not sure. He hasn't proposed yet.

It's kind of exciting to have a baby in the family again, though.

Me, too. I miss when my babies were babies.
