Did you hear Maria is pregnant?

Mom-GREEN
No way. Really?

Tia1-PINK
Yes! She's not telling anyone, but her mom told me.

Tia2-ORANGE
But she's not married, right?

Tia1-PINK
No!

Grandma-BLUE
Oh my god.

Mom-GREEN
Is he going to marry her?

Tia1-PINK
I'm not sure. He hasn't proposed yet.

Tia2-ORANGE
It's kind of exciting to have a baby in the family again, though.

Mom-GREEN
Me, too. I miss when my babies were babies.
